## Remaining Work

### High Priority (gameplay gaps)
- [ ] M9.1-9.3: mines (not implemented)

### Medium Priority (content/polish)
- [ ] M16.1: screen shake on explosions
- [ ] M16.4: main menu, UI polish

### Lower Priority (extra features)
- [ ] Phase 11: map editor (map_tool.py exists for CLI editing)
- [ ] Phase 12: game modes (deathmatch, CTF, domination)
- [ ] M5.1-5.2: formal collision API (current inline collision works)

## Plan Changes
- Networking phases (13-15) deferred indefinitely
- Focus on single-player campaign (complete)
- Enemies defined in map files (type, position)
- 3 enemy types with different stats/behaviors
